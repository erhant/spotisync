The most simple description of the program is that:
- Give 2 users, (either as two username-password pairs or authentication tokens)
- The program is running at this point, waiting for track input
  - *there are lots of ideas to do here*
  - At the simplest terms we input a song name (possibly the spotify URI) and play it at two phones
