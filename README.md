# SpotiSync
App that will play the same track on the devices of all connected users

##### User must have an active device for these to work. We can not force an inactive device to play a song.

## Acknowledgement
Big thanks to [Tomasz Lisowski](https://github.com/tomasz-lisowski), who wrote the frontend React and the authorization, basically almost all of the code. Great guy!

## Update
Spotify didn't have Group Session feature during the creation of this!
